 This code is a practice Java interview question from testdome.com
 
 https://www.testdome.com/questions/java/two-sum/10284?visibility=1&skillId=4
 
 Problem statement: Write a function that, given a list and a target sum, returns zero-based indices of any two distinct elements whose sum is equal to the target sum. If there are no such elements, the function should return null.

        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Waiting to be implemented.");
    }

        int[] indices = findTwoSum(new int[] { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 }, 12);
        System.out.println(indices[0] + " " + indices[1]);
    }
