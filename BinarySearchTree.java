 This code is a practice Java interview question from testdome.com
 https://www.testdome.com/questions/java/binary-search-tree/12975?visibility=1&skillId=4
 
 Problem statement: Write a function that checks if a given binary search tree contains a given value.
 	-Binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree where the value of each node is larger or equal to the values in all the nodes in that node's left subtree and is smaller than the values in all the nodes in that node's right subtree.

package BinarySearchTree;

class Node {
    public int value;
    public Node left, right;

    public Node(int value, Node left, Node right) {
        this.value = value;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

public class BinarySearchTree {
    public static boolean contains(Node root, int value) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Waiting to be implemented.");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Node n1 = new Node(1, null, null);
        Node n3 = new Node(3, null, null);
        Node n2 = new Node(2, n1, n3);
        
        System.out.println(contains(n2, 3));
    }
